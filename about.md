# Hi! 

Ena Chia is an undergraduate student at [CUNY New York City College of Technology](https://www.citytech.cuny.edu/physics/), majoring in Applied Computational Physics, and a fellow / student representative at [AstroCom NYC](https://cunyastro.org/astrocom/). Currently in search of understanding how the universe works. 

Ena Chia is currently a fellow at [AstroCom NYC](https://cunyastro.org/astrocom/), where she is working with [Dr. Charlotte Olsen](https://charlotteolsen.github.io) on a project to understand how time and location of star formation rate influences a galaxy's evolution. By using simulated data from [N-Body Shop](https://nbody.shop), they'll be able to trace back over time and analyze at which point do stars form. You can find her iPoster from American Astronomical Society 245 Meeting [here](https://aas245-aas.ipostersessions.com/default.aspx?s=0C-AD-83-74-34-C5-36-61-E8-4A-B5-38-BF-19-F9-F2&guestview=true). She was a finalist for the Chambliss Astronomy Achievement Student Award from the 245th Meeting. 

​More about her previous trajectory can be found here.

### **About Me**  

I’m Ena Chia, an aspiring astrophysicist with a deep curiosity about the universe and a passion for uncovering the fundamental processes that shape galaxies. My journey into astrophysics wasn’t conventional—I initially studied art, where I developed a strong ability to think abstractly and recognize patterns. Over time, I found that the problem-solving mindset I honed in art naturally extended to physics, leading me to explore the cosmos through research and computation.  

Currently, I’m a researcher at AstroCom NYC, where I analyze star formation rates and stellar mass in simulated galaxies to better understand how well we can reconstruct a galaxy’s past based on observations. My work involves computational astrophysics, coding, and data analysis, using tools like Python and PynBody to study large-scale simulations. I’m particularly drawn to theoretical and computational approaches, as they allow me to model and visualize astrophysical phenomena in new ways.  

Beyond research, I enjoy mentoring others and making complex astrophysical concepts more accessible, often drawing analogies between science and everyday experiences. I also have a keen interest in interdisciplinary approaches—bridging art and science to explore the universe from both a creative and analytical perspective.  

In the future, I aim to continue investigating the deeper physical processes governing galaxies, pushing the boundaries of what we know about the cosmos.
